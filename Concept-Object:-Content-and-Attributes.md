### Concept
Every term within a Narsese statement including statement itself in internal implementation is represented by a concept. For example, statement **<raven --> black>** is represented using three concepts: "raven", "black" and "<raven --> black>". The concept itself is an object, a big chunk of information, that includes much information beyond name of the concept itself. Concept incorporates numerous data structures including two "BAG" data structures where task-links and term-links are stored referred as "Task Bag" and "Term Bag" respectively.
