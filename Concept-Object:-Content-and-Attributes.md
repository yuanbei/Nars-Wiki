This page describes semantics and implementation of "concept" objects in OpenNARS. **Concept** is a major data item in OpenNARS system that is stored in "Bag" data structure and assigned budget value. Information present here is closely related to ["budget value"](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Budget-Value), ["working cycle of the system"](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Working-Cycle), ["task management"](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Tasks-Management-in-OpenNARS) and ["Types of Links"](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Types-of-Links:-task-and-term-links). Feel free to read those pages for better understanding. 

## Concept Semantics
OpenNARS is implemented using “term logic”, which is is characterized by the use of categorical sentences and syllogistic
inference rules. A property of term logic is that almost all inference rules use two premises which share a term. Term sharing is convenient since it naturally localizes the choice range of beliefs that is associated with participating terms only. For example, if [task](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Type-of-Links:-task-and-term-links) <raven --> bird>. is being processed, [beliefs](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Tasks-Management-in-OpenNARS) (processed judgements) that can directly interact with it must have terms “raven” or “bird” in it as subject or predicate.

Such logical approach led to organizing all the term-related information into big buckets or objects called **concepts**. In OpenNARS, all tasks and beliefs that share a common term are collected into a concept object, which is named by the shared term. As a result, any valid inference step necessarily happens within a single concept. Therefore, a concept becomes a unit for resource allocation, which is larger than a task or a belief. The system distributes its resources firstly among the concepts, and then secondly, within each concept, among the tasks and beliefs which are also stored using "bags". The result is a two-level memory structure where on each level, the notion of [“bag”](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/System-Memory-(bag,-overall-structure)) is applied. Thus we can describe system memory as a bag of concepts, with, within each concept, a bag of tasks and a bag of beliefs. 

## Implementation
Every term within a Narsese statement including statement itself in internal implementation is represented by a **concept**. For example, statement **<raven --> black>** is represented using three concepts: "raven", "black" and "<raven --> black>". The concept itself is an object, a big chunk of information, that includes much information beyond name of the concept itself. Concept incorporates numerous data structures including two "BAGs" data structures where task-links and term-links are stored referred as "Task Bag" and "Term Bag" respectively.
