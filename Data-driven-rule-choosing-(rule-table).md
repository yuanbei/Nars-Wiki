Given that OpenNARS operates under AIKR it demands vast computation resources in terms of space and time. Since it is not possible to satisfy all system demands a wise resource management is required. As described on ["working cycle"](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Working-Cycle-and-Tasks-Management-in-OpenNARS) during each derivation system selects a [task-link](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Types-of-Links:-task-and-term-links) and a [term-link](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Types-of-Links:-task-and-term-links), basically a task and belief, and applies particular inference or structural or some other rule  in order to make a derivation task. Depending on some "type" of task or term link certain subset of rules is applicable, then it is possible to pre-define certain types and condition such that a certain rules are applied if conditions are satisfied.     

**Data-driven rule choosing** is
