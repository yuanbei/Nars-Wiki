### Introduction

Roughly speaking, there will be three types of NARS:

1. NARS, which is general-purpose and under AIKR. There will be only one such model (with some variants), though each instantiation of the model can have different parameters, as well as different preloaded beliefs and tasks.
1. NARS+, which is NARS plus special-purpose plug-in operators, as organs or tools. There will be many such systems with different bodies and capabilities, and they won't fully understand each other, due to their difference in sensorimotor vocabulary.
1. NARS# (or call it "NARS@" as in NARS@NLP, or "NARS-" as in NARS-RL), which will be a customized and restricted version of NARS integrated with other techniques. Such a system will be designed for special situations (so not be an AGI anymore), won't be fully under AIKR, and nor will it have all the potentials of NARS.

Since NARS is now very stable and has reached a certain value of stability and completeness, we decided to create first application examples, also to proof that NARS works in domains where usual a lot of domain knowledge and special algorithms are needed, also domains where usually numerical learning algorithms are applied are shown. In all these examples, NARS is used and no special domain knowledge is input. (although NARS can make use of such knowledge) Usually AI in such domains is unable to master other such domains without programmatical changes and reconfigurations, or even more important, is not able to take knowledge from one domain to the other even if some situations might be similar and be solvable by similar solutions.
