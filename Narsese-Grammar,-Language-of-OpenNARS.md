The following article is intended for beginner to intermediate users who want to understand grammar used by OpenNARS in order to communicate with the system. 

There are 9 levels of Narsese Grammar levels that correspond to NARS Logic Levels ([NAL](https://github.com/opennars/opennars.wiki.git)). The higher the level the more complex is the grammar and the logic. In general levels can be divided into  two (2) groups: First-Order Statements (Levels 1-4) and Higher Order Statements (Level 5-9)

**First Order Narsese**
