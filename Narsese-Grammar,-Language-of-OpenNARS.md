The following article is intended for beginner to intermediate users who want to understand grammar used by OpenNARS in order to communicate with the system. 

There are 9 levels of [Narsese](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/OpenNARS-Glossary) Grammar levels that correspond to NARS Logic Levels ([NAL](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Non-Axiomatic-Logic-(NAL),-Logic-behind-OpenNARS)). The higher the level the more complex is the grammar and the logic. In general levels can be divided into  two (2) groups: First-Order Statements (Levels 1-4) and Higher Order Statements (Level 5-9)
