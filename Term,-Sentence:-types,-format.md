### Term

In OpenNARS and Narsese grammar **term** is a part of a sentence that appear at any side of a copula (connector). 

Consider a judgment statement (discussed below) "raven is black", in [Narsese](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Input-Output-Format) it will look as <raven --> [black]>.%1.0;0.9% 

Now both "raven" and "[black]" are terms that in this particular case along with inheritence [copula](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Narsese-symbol-list-(ASCII-version-)) create a judgment statement. In a more complex Narsese statements, terms may be statements themselves for example consider statement  "John knows that whale is a kind of mammal" that is <*({John},<whale --> mammal>) --> knows>. %1.0;0.9% Here term "<whale --> mammal>" is a sentence itself that is part of a bigger statement.    can be one of two types: atomic and compound. Atomic term is just a word
