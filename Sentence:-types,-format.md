A Narsese **sentence** has a _statement_ as content, and can be one of the four types:
* **Judgement** is the most common type of sentence that consists of a statement with a truth-value attached. Formally, a judgment is a statement ended by "**.**" and followed by a truth-value. Example: **<raven --> [black]>. %1.0;0.9%**
* **Question** is the type of sentence without truth-value attached and may contain variables. It asks the system to find or create a judgment as an answer. There are two types of questions: evaluative and selective. An evaluative question is of the form **Sta?** and the system should decide the truth-value for the statement **Sta**, whatever form it has. A selective question is on statement containing query variables, such as **<?x --> T>?** or **<T --> ?x>?** and the system is asked to come up with judgment where the [variable](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Use-of-Variables-in-OpenNARS) _x_ is unified with some term. Questions are always finished with "**?**" at the end.
* **Goal** is the type of sentence with an [event](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Temporal-Inference) to be realized by the system by executing some operations. The attached desire value is the truth-value of the system's belief that the realization of the goal is desired.  Goals ask the system to carry out some operation in order to achieve the goal. A goal is formed as a statement followed by "**!**". 
* **Quest** is a sentence that is similar to the question, however, while the question asks a truth-value, a quest asks a desire-value. Quests are finished with "**@**" in the implementation.

A sentence also keeps the time it is created and its evidential base.

### Evidential base

Each input task is assigned a _serial number_. During the derivation process a derived task stores the serial numbers of the input tasks it is derived from in a list which is called its **evidential base**. Derivation process can be considered as a tree where two parent-tasks create a derived child-task after a certain inference step. The evidential base of a child is a union of evidential bases of its parents. Obviously, after numerous inference steps, it is technically impossible to store all ancestors' serial numbers in a child's evidential base, so current implementation limits the length of the evidential base to a constant (which is a system parameter, currently is 4). Therefore, it is possible that after some derivation steps, some evidence is mistakenly reused when calculating the truth-value of a conclusion. With insufficient resources, this is inevitable, and we can also find similar effects in human cognition -- human does not remember all the information that led to a certain conclusion. As far as the evidential base is not too small, this will not cause big problems.
