On this page only sentences are discussed as a complete structural derivations that consist of terms.  Do not mix them with "term as a statement" discussed on [term](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Term:-types,-format) page and do not mix sentence with statement. Statement has only meaning with no truth value attached but sentence is a statement with truth or desire value with only exception to Question type sentences.

**Sentence** can be one of the four types: Judgment, Question, Goal and Quest. Sentence in Narsese is enclosed within "<" and ">" symbols and except for Questions must have pair of rational numbers attached which is either [truth-value](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Truth-Value:-Definition-and-Examples) or [desire-value](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Desire-Value:-Definition-and-Examples)
