## Background

OpenNARS uses "BAG" data structure which on abstract level can be viewed as priority queue with probabilistic behavior of _get()_ operation, that is an item is removed from the queue with some probability. Such  data structure is used to store most of the information present during system's run-time, including _task-links_, _term-links_ and _concepts_.

### Concept
Every term within a Narsese statement including statement itself in internal implementation is represented by a concept. For example, statement **<raven --> black>** is represented using three concepts: "raven", "black" and "<raven --> black>". The concept itself is an object, a big chunk of information, that includes much information beyond name of the concept itself. Concept incorporates numerous data structures including two "BAG" data structures where task-links and term-links are stored referred as "Task Bag" and "Term Bag" respectively.
