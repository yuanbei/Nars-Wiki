## Revision Rule
Revision is an inference step in which evidence from different sources is being combined and its truth value revised. 
Suppose there are two tasks with different truth values, for example: 
<br/><br/>
**<snow --> {white}>. %9/10, 10/11% ** here _(frequency, confidence)_ mean that snow has been observed white 9 times and 1 time it was not white, thus the total evidence is 10, positive evidence is 9/10 and given that by default _k=1_ confidence is 10/11
