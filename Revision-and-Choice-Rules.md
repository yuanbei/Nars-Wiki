## Revision Rule
<br/><br/>
Revision is an inference step in which evidence from different sources is being combined and its truth value revised. 
Suppose there are two tasks with different truth values, for example: 
<br/><br/>
<snow --> {white}>. %9/10, 10/11% here _%frequency, confidence%_ mean that snow has been observed white 9 times and 1 time it was not white, thus the total evidence is 10 and positive evidence is 9, given that by default _k=1_ confidence
