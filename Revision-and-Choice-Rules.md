## Revision Rule
Revision is an inference step in which evidence from different sources is being combined and its truth value revised. 
Suppose there are two tasks with different truth values, for example: 
<br/><br/>
**<snow --> {white}>. %9/10, 10/11%** here _(frequency, confidence)_ mean that snow has been observed white 9 times and 1 time it was not white, thus the total evidence is 10, positive evidence is 9/10 and given that by default _k=1_ confidence is 10/11
<br/><br/>
**<snow --> {white}>. %3/4, 4/5%** meaning that snow has been observed white 3 times and there are 4 total observations
<br/><br/>
Now suppose these two tasks has disjoint evidential spaces that is they have no overlapping evidences then they can be summarized into a task with revised truth value.
<br/><br/>
Basically the idea is to combine positive and total evidences and pick a function that maps appropriately map it to relevant _frequency_ and _confidence_ values
