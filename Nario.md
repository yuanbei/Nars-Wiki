More complex games like jumps and runs usually have a lot more than above, logical strict coherences in the environment, physical dynamics, partial observability, and so on. AI which plays such games usually knows everything (has a complete model), or has tremendous training time or computational resources in order to deal with such domains. Here you can watch NARS starting from no knowledge, learning to jump over obstacles and so on.
