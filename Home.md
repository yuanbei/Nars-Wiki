Welcome to the opennars wiki!

Open-NARS is the open source version of the NARS project, which attempts to uniformly explain and reproduce many cognitive facilities, including reasoning, learning, planning, etc, so as to provide a unified theory, model, and system for AI as a whole. The ultimate goal of this research is to build a thinking machine.

What makes NARS different from conventional computer systems is its ability to learn from its experience and to work with insufficient knowledge and resources.

This project is still mostly at the conceptual design and prototype development stage. If you are interested to join this research, the best place to start reading is the Wiki pages, not the source code.
