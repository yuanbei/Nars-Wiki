Open-NARS is the open source version of the [NARS](https://sites.google.com/site/narswang/home) project, which attempts to uniformly explain and reproduce many cognitive facilities, including reasoning, learning, planning, etc, so as to provide a unified theory, model, and system for AI as a whole. The ultimate goal of this research is to build a thinking machine.

The current stable versions of the system are available for [download](https://drive.google.com/a/temple.edu/folderview?id=0B8Z4Yige07tBUk5LSUtxSGY0eVk&usp=sharing#). Each version contains a JAR file and some working examples. [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/java8-2100321.html) is needed to run the recent versions.

The source code maintained at this site is for OpenNARS 1.5.7. After that, the development has moved to the [Github site](https://github.com/opennars/opennars), though this site still serves as the portal of this open-source project.
