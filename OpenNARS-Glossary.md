**C**
<br/><br/>
**Copula** - a relational operator used within statement to indicate substitutability between terms
<br/><br/>
**Confidence** - part of [truth-value](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Truth-Value:-Definition-and-Examples), measures the stability of a belief
<br/><br/>
**D**
<br/><br/>
**Detachment** - an inference where the condition of a conditional statement is evaluated, such as to use **S** and **S-->P** to derive **P**
<br/><br/>
**Durability** - part of [budget-value](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Budget-Value), measures priority decay of an item in a bag, and lager values mean to be remembered longer
<br/><br/>
**E**
<br/><br/>
**Evidence** - for statement **S-->P**, its evidence is a term in the union of the _extension _of **S** and the _intension_ of **P**, and among them, the common _extension_ and common _intension_ of the two terms contain **positive** evidence, while the rest is **negative** evidence
<br/><br/>
**[Evidential Basis](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Revision-and-Choice-Rules)** - each [truth-value](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Truth-Value:-Definition-and-Examples) has an evidential bass, that is a list of serial numbers of the tasks from which the truth-value has been derived from
<br/><br/>
**Extension** - the extension of a term _T_ contains terms that each of them, _x_, is related to _T_ by _x-->T_
<br/><br/>
**Extensional Set** - a compound term defined by listing its instances
<br/><br/>
**F**
<br/><br/>
**Frequency** - part of [truth-value](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Truth-Value:-Definition-and-Examples), measures the propotion of positive evidence among available evidence
<br/><br/>
**I**
<br/><br/>
**Intension** - the intension of a term _T_ contains terms that each of them, _x_, is related to _T_ by _T-->x_
<br/><br/>
T)
<br/><br/>
**Intensional set** - a compound term defined by listing its prperties
<br/><br/>
**N**
<br/><br/>
**[NAL](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Non-Axiomatic-Logic-(NAL),-Logic-behind-OpenNARS)** - Non-Axiomatic Logic, the logic followed by OpenNARS<br/>
**[Narsese](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Narsese-Grammar,-Language-of-OpenNARS)** - The formal langauge used in OpenNARS for representation and communication
<br/><br/>

**P**
<br /><br/>
**[Predicate term](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Narsese-Grammar,-Language-of-OpenNARS)** - term used to the right of [copula](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Narsese-Grammar,-Language-of-OpenNARS)
<br /><br/>
**R**
<br /><br/>
**[Revision rule](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Revision-and-Choice-Rules)** - rule applied during inference step when evidence comes from different sources and needs to be combined. In this step _frequency_ and _confidence_ values are revised based on some preconditions
<br /><br/>
**S**
<br /><br/>
**Statement** - Connection of two terms, subject and predicate, with a copula.
<br /><br/>
**[Subject term](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Narsese-Grammar,-Language-of-OpenNARS)** - term used to the left of [copula](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Narsese-Grammar,-Language-of-OpenNARS)
<br /><br/>


**T**
<br /><br/>
**Term** - simplest atomic structure within a grammar statement, basically a string of letters in alphabet
<br/><br/>
**Transitive Closure** - given that inheritance (-->) relation is transitive, that is if A-->B and B-->C then A-->C, closure is a set of statements generated by closure-algorithm using transitivity property  
<br/>
**Truth value** - each task is assigned a truth value, that is a pair of real numbers (frequency and confidence) in the range [0, 1]
<br/><br/>
**[Truth expectation](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Revision-and-Choice-Rules)** - a measurement that combines _frequency_ with _confidence_ and maps to real number value in range [0,1]. It is used to measure total importance of a statement when comparing different statements and choice is necessary.
<br/><br/>
**[Truth-value Functions](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Truth-Functions)** - functions that determine truth value under different logical inferences
