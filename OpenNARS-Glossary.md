**C**
<br/><br/>
**[Copula](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Narsese-Grammar,-Language-of-OpenNARS)** - a relational operator used within statement to indicate relationship between terms
<br/><br/>
**D**
<br/><br/>
**Durability** - measurement of computational resources allocated in priority data structure, it is attached to the concept and also serves as a time decay similar to human memory that tends to forget things
<br/><br/>
**E**
<br/><br/>
**Extension** - extension of a term is a set of terms that appears to the LEFT of inheritance copula (x-->T, where x is extension of t)
<br/><br/>
**Extensional Set** - 
<br/><br/>
**I**
<br/><br/>
**Intension** - intension of a term is a set of terms that appears to the RIGHT of inheritance copula (T-->x where x is intension of T)
<br/><br/>
**Intensional set** - 
<br/><br/>
**N**
<br/><br/>
**[NAL](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Non-Axiomatic-Logic-(NAL),-Logic-behind-OpenNARS)** - Non-Axiomatic Logic core logic used in OpenNARS <br />
**[Narsese](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Narsese-Grammar,-Language-of-OpenNARS)** - Grammar Statement used for communication with OpenNARS control mechanism
<br /><br />

**P**
<br /><br/>
**[Predicate term](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Narsese-Grammar,-Language-of-OpenNARS)** - term used to the right of [copula](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Narsese-Grammar,-Language-of-OpenNARS)
<br /><br/>

**S**
<br /><br/>
**Statement** - Connection of two terms, subject and predicate, with a copula.
<br /><br/>
**[Subject term](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Narsese-Grammar,-Language-of-OpenNARS)** - term used to the left of [copula](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Narsese-Grammar,-Language-of-OpenNARS)
<br /><br/>


**T**
<br /><br/>
**Term** - simplest atomic structure within a grammar statement, basically a string of letters in alphabet<br /><br/>
**Transitive Closure** - given that inheritance (-->) relation is transitive, that is if A-->B and B-->C then A-->C, closure is a set of statements generated by closure-algorithm using transitivity property
