Compound Terms, Set Operations and **compositional rules** are introduced in NAL-3 and briefly mentioned on [NAL page](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Non-Axiomatic-Logic-(NAL),-Logic-behind-OpenNARS) however since it is one of the major aspect of reasoning in OpenNARS they are described here in more detail.

Before rules are established themselfs Compound terms needed to be specified, basically compouind terms are term that consists from multiple components or formally: <br/> _A compound term (con C1,...,Cn) is a term formed by a term connector, con, that **connects** one or more terms that are called the components of the compound._ <br/>The order of the components does matter, and the components are allowed to be same. Term connector is a logical constant with no internal structure and connectors are predefined as part of NALs.
