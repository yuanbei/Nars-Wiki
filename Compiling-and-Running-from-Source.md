To be able to compile and run from source code the following is required:
<br/><br/>
**1.** Java jdk 1.8 or higher
<br/><br/>
**2.** git  
<br/>
**3.** Maven can be obtained from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
<br/><br/>
**4.** Java, git and Maven must be written to environment variables such that they are accessible from terminal
<br/><br/>
**Note:** In order to use OpenNARS launcher, OpenNARS needs to be installed in three stages: 
<br/><br/>
**a.** terminal version of OpenNARS where Narsese statements can be entered from the terminal only
<br/><br/>
**b.** OpenNARS GUI where Narsese statements are entered within GUI, and derivations, output and other useful info can also be seen
<br/><br/>
**c.** OpenNARS Lab - test cases that demonstrate NARS functionality and abilities
<br/><br/>

## Instruction to compile and run OpenNARS from source code using Maven
<br/><br/>
**1.** Create a directory and navigate to it
<br/><br/>
**2.** Clone git repository by typing git clone https://github.com/opennars/opennars.git
<br/><br/>
**3.** For Windows users only, **skip this step if using Unix or MAC**. In order for maven to find valid JDK _**JAVA_HOME**_ variable must point to the correct location, just set it to your directory of JDK. Example: **set JAVA_HOME="C:\Progra~1\Java\jdk1.8.0_121"**
