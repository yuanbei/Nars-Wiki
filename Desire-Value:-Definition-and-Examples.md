Desire Value applies to [goal](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Sentence:-types,-format) sentences and is key element in [procedural knowledge](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Procedural-Inference). Desire value has identical to [truth value format](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Truth-Value:-Definition-and-Examples) however it has a different semantics.

During run time of a system there are usually multiple conflicting goals exist. Often achieving one goal makes another one harder to be achieved, therefore system must make decision which goal is better to pursue. Furthermore,  goals may not always be related to each other and thus we cannot expect the system to have explicit knowledge to handle goal conflicts. Desire value is a learned metrics that allows system to compare goals and make a selection during goal conflicts.

As mentioned above, desire value has the same format as truth value, and in fact the two metrics are very related. [Truth functions](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Truth-Functions), [revision and choice rules](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Revision-and-Choice-Rules) are applied to to calculate desire value during inference. Suppose the system is asked to achieve goal _G_, then there should be a hypothetical desired state _D_ of the system after the goal is achieved. Then, given the state D one can form the implication statement S, that is **<G ==> D>**, and the truth value of S can either come from input if goal is supplied by the user or be derived in ordinary way as for any [implication statement](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Statements-and-Variables-in-OpenNARS)
