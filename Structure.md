Structural rules are introduced when sentence becomes larger in structure. With NAL-3 compound terms, sets and set operations are introduced that allows creation of more sophisticated structure for both term and sentences that leads [compositional rules](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Composition). NAL-4 Introduce relations on top of sets and its operation leading to structural manipulations and inference.  

It is important to mention three types of relation present in OpenNARS NAL 1-3

**Syntactic relation:** A syntactic relation is between a compound term and its components, like the relation between raven and (raven âˆ’ [black]). These relations are indicated by the term connector of the compound "-" <br/>

**Semantic relation:** A semantic relation is between the subject term and the predicate term of a statement, like the relation between raven and bird in <raven --> bird>. These relations are indicated by the copula "-->" of the statement<br/>

**Acquired relation:** An acquired relation is among components of a product, like the relation between raven and worm in <(*,raven, worm) --> food>. <br/>
