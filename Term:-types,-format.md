In NARS a **term** refers to a concept within the system, as a part of a [sentence](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Sentence:-types,-format) that expresses the relation between some concepts. 

Consider a sentence (discussed below) "Ravens are black", in [Narsese](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Narsese-Grammar-(Input-Output-Format)) it can be represented as <br/><br/>**<raven --> [black]>.%1.0;0.9%**<br/><br/>
Now both "raven" and "[black]" are terms that in this particular case along with inheritence [copula](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Narsese-symbol-list-(ASCII-version-)) create a statement. The statement  plus the punctiation and truth-value form a **judgment**, which is a type of [sentence](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Sentence:-types,-format). In more complex Narsese sentences, terms may be statements themselves. For example, consider sentence "John knows that whale is a kind of mammal" that is <br/><br/>**<(*, {John}, {<whale --> mammal>}) --> knows>. %1.0;0.9%**<br/><br/> Here term "<whale --> mammal>" is a statement itself that consists of simpler terms "whale" and "mammal" which all are part of a sentence. 

In the above example, a term can be one of three types: atomic, compound, and statement (which is a special type of compound term). All three types of terms can have relations with each other. 

An **atomic** term is just a word as in the first example, it is a unique identifier with no internal structure. 

A **compound** term is more complex. It is formed by a _connector_ from one or more terms, called its _components_. The order of components usually matters. In the second example there is a compound term **(\*, {John},{<whale --> mammal>})** here it consists of two components "{John}" and "{<whale --> mammal>}" connected by the _product_ connector "*". All connectors are listed in the [grammar of Narsese](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Narsese-Grammar-(Input-Output-Format)).

A **statement** is a special type of compound term that can be part of a bigger compound term. Such a term only has a binary truth-value, except that it is the outermost statement that is not a component of an even larger compound. As in the second example, <whale --> mammal> is a statement that is a component of a larger compound term, and it only states that "whale is mammal" with an implicit truth-value "true", which is different from the numerical truth-value attached to the entire sentence. 

**Syntactic Complexity**: the _syntactic complexity_ of a term is defined recursively. If it is atomic its syntactic complexity is 1. If it is a compound, then its syntactic complexity is one plus the sum of the syntactic complexity of its components. As the name suggests, this measurement says nothing about the _semantic_ complexity of the term and the concept it refers to.
