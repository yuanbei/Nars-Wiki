OpenNARS operates on logic layers called NALs, there are nine NAL levels (NALs 1-9). NAL levels are added one by one each of which expands the features and capabilities of a previous layer including the [grammar](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Narsese-Grammar,-Language-of-OpenNARS), inference rules and [truth functions](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Truth-Functions). This article presents each level and briefly describes its features.

In general nine NAL levels are divided into two groups: **First-Order Inference (NALs 1-4)** and **Higher-Order Inferences (NALs 5-9)**

## First-Order Inference (NALs 1-4)
### NAL-1

NAL-1 is a logical foundation of OpenNARS, it operates on well known logical inference rules of _[deduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning), [abduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning), [induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning) and exemplification_. 

Brief description
1. _Deduction_: {M → P <f1, c1 >, S → M <f2, c2 >} |-- S → P <f, c>
This is Aristotle’s first figure, and what Peirce called deduction.
2. _Abduction_:  {P → M <f1, c1 >, S → M <f2, c2 >} |-- S → P <f, c>
This is Aristotle’s second figure, and what Peirce called abduction
(and hypothesis)
3. _Induction_ {M → P <f1, c1 >, M → S <f2, c2 >} |-- S → P <f, c>
This is Aristotle’s third figure, and what Peirce called induction
4. {M → P <f1, c1 >, S → M <f2, c2 >} |-- S → P <f, c>
This rule, not discussed by Aristotle or Peirce, in NAL it is called
exemplification, basically reversed deduction

NAL-1 introduces key features of OpenNARS: inheritance relation, use of evidence through truth value, inference rules, truth functions and Narsese-1 grammar. 
Truth value is a pair of real numbers in the range [0,1] that are called **frequency** and **confidence**. **Frequency** is a measurement of uncertainty defined as positive evidence / total evidence, while **confidence** measures degree of believe, given _k_ as a temporal constant, might be seen as number of steps taken by the system in the future, confidence _c_ is defined in terms of evidence w as _c = w / (w + k)_, default value for _k_ is 1
