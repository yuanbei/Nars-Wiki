OpenNARS operates on logic layers called NALs, there are nine NAL levels (NALs 1-9). NAL levels are added one by one each of which expands the features and capabilities of a previous layer including the [grammar](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Narsese-Grammar,-Language-of-OpenNARS), inference rules and [truth functions](https://github.com/opennars/opennars/wiki/Truth-Functions). This article introduces each level and briefly describes its features.

In general nine NALs level are divided in **First-Order Inference (NALs 1-4)** and **Higher-Order Inferences (NALs 5-9)**
